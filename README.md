This is the updated project Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph, now enhanced using Bootstrap frameworks The project also includes a map feature to visually represent the paths, making it easier for users to understand the possible routes and the shortest path.
This project aims to provide an educational tool for understanding graph algorithms and a practical application for booking services based on the shortest path calculations.


## Features:
1. Breadth-First Search Algorithm: Utilizes BFS to determine the shortest path between vertices in a graph.
2. Path Visualization: The map component visually displays the possible paths (edges) and the shortest path, providing a clear graphical representation.
3. Booking System Integration: Users can book services directly through the application, integrated seamlessly into the pathfinding system.
4. Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap to ensure the application is mobile-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes.
5. Interactive UI: Includes color-coded indicators for different paths and markers for locations (vertices) for an intuitive user experience.
6. Distance Calculation: It calculates the distance from origin to destination.

## Technologies Used:
1. HTML & CSS: For the basic structure and styling of the web pages.
2. JavaScript: To implement the BFS algorithm and handle user interactions.
3. Bootstrap: For responsive design and consistent UI components.
4. Map Integration: To display paths and locations visually on an interactive map.
   
I welcome any corrections, suggestions, or feedback to improve the project further.
